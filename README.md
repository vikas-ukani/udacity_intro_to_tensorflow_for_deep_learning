# Udacity Introduction to TensorFlow For Deep Learning.

## Intro to Machine Learning

- This class will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens, and you'll apply what you've learned to a real-world data set.

### Lesson 1 - Welcome to Machine Learning
- Meet with Sebastian and Katie to discuss machine learning.

### Lesson 2 - Navie Bayes
- Learn about classification, training and testing, and run a naive Bayes classifier using Scikit Learn.

### Lesson 3 - SVM
- Build an intuition about how support vector machines (SVMs) work and implement one using scikit-learn.

### Lesson 4 - Decision trees
- Learn about how the decision tree algorithm works, including the concepts of entropy and information gain.

### Lesson 5 - Choose you own Model
- In this mini project, you will extend your toolbox of algorithms by choosing your own algorithm to classify terrain data, including k-nearest neighbors, AdaBoost, and random forests.
